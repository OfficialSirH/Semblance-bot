**Privacy Policy** 
 
SirH built the Semblance app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by SirH at no cost and is intended for use as is.
 
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
 
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
 
**Information Collection and Use**
 
For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Discord User IDs. Users are cached for approximately 30 seconds if they use any command before being removed from cache unless the user is required for the proper functioning of certain commands. All of the User data that is collected by the bot is stored on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), which uses AES256-CBC via OpenSSL for data encryption and AES-256 uses a symmetric key; i.e. the same key to encrypt and decrypt text. The bot is hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).
 
**Log Data**
 
 • If you were to use the `jump` command in your server, your Discord Guild’s id will be stored for the proper functioning of the command’s feature. 
 • Usage of either the `afk` or `remindme` command will have your optional input, including your user ID, be stored until its use isn’t necessary anymore. 
 • Voting for Semblance on bot listing sites(i.e. Top.gg) and usage of Semblance’s idle-game(`game`) will keep your user ID until a future data reset or if requested.
 •  The usage of the `report` command is restricted primarily to the official Cell to Singularity Discord server and stores your user ID until the said report you’ve made is deleted or denied.
 
**Service Providers**
 
I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
 
• To facilitate our Service;
• To provide the Service on our behalf;
• To perform Service-related services; or
• To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
 
I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
 
**Links to Other Sites**
 
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
 
**Changes to This Privacy Policy**
 
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
 
This policy is effective as of 2021-01-23
